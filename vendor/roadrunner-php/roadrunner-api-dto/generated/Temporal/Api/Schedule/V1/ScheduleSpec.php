/**
 * ScheduleSpec is a complete description of a set of absolute timestamps
 * (possibly infinite) that an action should occur at. The meaning of a
 * ScheduleSpec depends only on its contents and never changes, except that the
 * definition of a time zone can change over time (most commonly, when daylight
 * saving time policy changes for an area). To create a totally self-contained
 * ScheduleSpec, use UTC or include timezone_data.
 * For input, you can provide zero or more of: structured_calendar, calendar,
 * cron_string, interval, and exclude_structured_calendar, and all of them will
 * be used (the schedule will take action at the union of all of their times,
 * minus the ones that match exclude_structured_calendar).
 * On input, calendar and cron_string fields will be compiled into
 * structured_calendar (and maybe interval and timezone_name), so if you
 * Describe a schedule, you'll see only structured_calendar, interval, etc.
 * If a spec has no matching times after the current time, then the schedule
 * will be subject to automatic deletion (after several days).
