/**
 * Priority contains metadata that controls relative ordering of task processing
 * when tasks are backed up in a queue. Initially, Priority will be used in
 * matching (workflow and activity) task queues. Later it may be used in history
 * task queues and in rate limiting decisions.
 * Priority is attached to workflows and activities. By default, activities
 * inherit Priority from the workflow that created them, but may override fields
 * when an activity is started or modified.
 * Despite being named "Priority", this message also contains fields that
 * control "fairness" mechanisms.
 * For all fields, the field not present or equal to zero/empty string means to
 * inherit the value from the calling workflow, or if there is no calling
 * workflow, then use the default value.
 * For all fields other than fairness_key, the zero value isn't meaningful so
 * there's no confusion between inherit/default and a meaningful value. For
 * fairness_key, the empty string will be interpreted as "inherit". This means
 * that if a workflow has a non-empty fairness key, you can't override the
 * fairness key of its activity to the empty string.
 * The overall semantics of Priority are:
 * 1. First, consider "priority": higher priority (lower number) goes first.
 * 2. Then, consider fairness: try to dispatch tasks for different fairness keys
 *    in proportion to their weight.
 * Applications may use any subset of mechanisms that are useful to them and
 * leave the other fields to use default values.
 * Not all queues in the system may support the "full" semantics of all priority
 * fields. (Currently only support in matching task queues is planned.)
